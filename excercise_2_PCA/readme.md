# Exercise 2 - PCA


## Our opinions on the exercise / plan how to solve it / what was already used - what's new.



## Exercise 2.1: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Here we in general will need to do kNN with the PCA-based dimensionality reduction
	check the performance - time and maybe also accuracy?
	
	
## Exercise 2.2: Normalization
min-max normalization and z-standarization
also do then knn with 10 fold cross-validation


## Exercise 2.3: Preprocessing
applying smoothing to the images and cross validation


## Exercise 2.4: Reconstruction using PCA
plotting eigenvectors as images
Maybe 2.4.3 will be difficult
how to re-recreate -> checking how data size was reduced etc
