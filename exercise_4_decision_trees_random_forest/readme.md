# Random trees

## lecture notes



4.1 at the end we need 5 graphs

x - is the threshold

y which of the thresholds give the highest point

we can use rpart or C50 libraries


4.1.3 use full dataset, do cross validation

Compare training tree with PCA and without PCA.

If tree trained with pca (5 first pcs) later when we evalueate dataset, should project to the pcas and the scores. If we use raw data then the treees training in 324 dimensions -> later test dataset also need to have the same 324 dimensions.


Example code should be given later
