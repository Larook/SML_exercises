check the parameters thoroughly
say why you choose those parameters
parameters might differ for small and big dataset

many parameters - too much time to compute

report results on the train and test set!

Solve the problem for both data disjunct and all the data!!!

Don't use equations - rather show images on how the preprocessing / classification work

Make short introduction to classification method

Intuitive understanding of the methods is important!!!! It's what matters also on the exam

Report should be short as possible, but condensed

Around 8 pages - short and to the point

to get the biggest dataset - combine the 4 of itslearning datasets -> new dataset should be uploaded to itslearning soon

1. Describe the dataset
2. Show digits
3. Do preprocessing (smoothing, etc)
4. Choose the method
	5. Do the method on disjunct and all-in
	describe things shortly, intuitively and in proper manner
	6. Compare the results on the disjunct and all-in






Exam questions:
Why do we do PCA - to reduce the dimensions of the data, reduce noise
Is PCA only about reducing noise? Is it the only application?
Not only - it also speeds up the classification of knn. Training and evaluation
What is the time complexity of knn?

Do we need training and time for training in knn?
only for storing the data in dataset - lazy learner
Why is it lazy learner? Because it doesnt do any learning
in knn complexity -> only matching/classyfing time
What are the parameters? n and m
feature components 
n - number of nearest neighbours

Every question will be a dialogue - that's the form of exam.








Exercise 5 presented reports:
How to analyse overfitting
Difference of accuracy on the training and test set
